      what and what not to represent in a database design. This  is somewhat understandable if you have never designed
      a database before.  However, please consider that a database design represents the (static) data <strong>only</strong>.
      It <strong>does not</strong> represent the kinds of operations that users can  perform on the data.</td>

    <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=15><P><B>A:</B></P></TD>
    <TD>No, you don't have to give attributes a datatype. The only constraints  on attributes that you need to specify are whether they are a key or a  discriminator.</TD>

    <TD>It should be obvious that the names of people cannot be unique so you cannot assume that 
    the names of PC members are unique. In real life, people are quite adept at distinguishing 
    between different people with the same name. In the context of the E-R model for 
    the application, you  can tell who gave a comment by seeing to which PC member a comment is  related.</TD>

    <TD>Does an  author or the contact author submit the papers. 
    As stated in the project description, the first stage is that the author submits only the information, 
    and the second stage is the contact author submits the paper? However, in the Q&amp;A, you mentioned 
    that "It will usually be the  author who submits the submission."</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=15><P><B>A:</B></P></TD>
    <TD>To submit a paper a login account is needed as described in the problem description 
    and it is stated that the contact author needs a login account to manage a submission, 
    which includes creating the submission information and uploading the submission. 
    The previous answer should have said "It will usually be the contact author who submits the submission." 
    Our mistake.</TD>

    <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=15><P><B>A:</B></P></TD>
    <TD>No, of course not. A PC member is first assigned a submission to review. 
    After reading the submission he/she will create a review. 
    So, a PC member must be able to exist <b>before</b> having completed any review. 
    This is just common sense.</TD>

    <TD>In the Q&amp;A page, it is mentioned that there is one set of discussions per submission. 
    Shouldn't it be a set of comments by PC members which are part of the discussion?</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=15><P><B>A:</B></P></TD>
    <TD>We view each comment as a discussion and all the comments as one set of discussions, 
    but if you want to view it differently, then that's OK.</TD>

  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=15><P><B>A:</B></P></TD>
    <TD><p>The project description states "the system should be general purpose and standalone so that 
    each conference can use it to manage its own submissions and reviews." 
    So, each database that is managed by the system is for one and only one conference. 
    In other words, each conference has its own database, just like each student has their own database for the labs. 
    Whatever you do on the database that you create in the lab does not affect the database of any other student 
    even though you are all using the same Oracle database server and the same relational schema. 
      
    Similarly, the conference databases cannot interfere with each other since each conference
    creates their own database for their conference based on the schema that you are designing.</p></TD>

  <TR>
    <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=15><P><B>A:</B></P></TD>
    <TD>Technically no, but practically, as stated in the problem description, a contact author will need 
    to create a login account before he/she submits anything. So, at least the contact author shoud be able 
    to exist before a submission exists. However, the modeling requirement is that each author is related 
    to at least one submission. How this is realized is dealt with later during implementation of the database.</TD>

    <TD>No entity <b><i>requires</i></b> a unique identifier. It is <b><u>not</u></b> a requirement of the E-R model,

  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=15><P><B>A:</B></P></TD>
    <TD>For E-R schema design purposes, you should pick the option that makes it most clear what you are representing. Often there are several "correct" options, but one of them may more clearly communicate the requirement. Since E-R diagrams are also used for communication with clients, this is an important consideration.</TD>

  <TR>
