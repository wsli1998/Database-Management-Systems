do we need sql developer in the vm?

Man Kit LAU
13:35
Try to have the same environment as ours, so that we can easier to give help. This avoids some particular problem in a particular version where the problem doesn't occur in our version. So, please use VDIT windows 10.

Man Kit LAU
14:35
No need. The VDIT Windows 10 looks like a remote machine. If you need to use sql develop, you can switch back to your machine.

Man Kit LAU
43:43
For the problem about The name 'Global' does not exist. I have said that this is your environment problem.
default user avatar
KIM, Taek Jung
43:54
so I asked How to fix it?
default user avatar
KIM, Taek Jung
43:59
so I thought this was the answer
default user avatar
Man Kit LAU
44:02
I don't know whether you havn't install ODAC 18.3 or some other setting in your environment.
default user avatar
KIM, Taek Jung
44:55
I have tried installing odac, I downloaded it
default user avatar
KIM, Taek Jung
45:05
when I press setup, it does not install it
default user avatar
Man Kit LAU
45:19
Then, it means you havn't install it?
default user avatar
KIM, Taek Jung
45:22
that is why I asked if I can share screen, but you said no
default user avatar
Man Kit LAU
45:30
But you have to.
default user avatar
Ka Hing LAM
45:37
I cant install odac 18.3 because in the step Oracle developer tools for visual studio does not have the choose vs2019
default user avatar
KIM, Taek Jung
45:55
it does not let me install odac18.3
default user avatar
Man Kit LAU
45:55
You share screen to me, I still don't know you havn't install ODAC.
default user avatar
KIM, Taek Jung
46:12
I was going to ask why I cannot install odac
default user avatar
CHAN Wang Kiu wkchanat
46:20
my laptop does not support installing ODAC too, so i bet the only solution is to use virtual barn
default user avatar
Man Kit LAU
46:29
The solution I suggest is that, try connect to virtual barn
default user avatar
Man Kit LAU
46:51
ODAC is necessary, your machine cannot install it, then you cannot use your machine to do this lab or task 3
default user avatar
KIM, Taek Jung
46:51
you never suggested that, you only asked why am I not using virtual barn
default user avatar
CHAN Wang Kiu wkchanat
46:54
n i have searched for hours yesterday, but none of the suggestions helps the installation
default user avatar
KIM, Taek Jung
46:57
okay Iwill try
default user avatar
Man Kit LAU
47:26
At the beginning, I have said that you should use virtual barn so that you are in the same environment as us
default user avatar
KIM, Taek Jung
48:25
thank you for your help
default user avatar
Man Kit LAU
48:49
To Kiu, If it cannot be installed in your machine, then you cannot use your machine for the lab and task 3
default user avatar
Man Kit LAU
49:18
Virtual barn may sometimes frozen due to a lot of connections. But simply retry until you can connect.
default user avatar
Man Kit LAU
49:34
Or let me know if you have problem on connecting to virtual barn.
default user avatar
CHAN Wang Kiu wkchanat
49:59
btw we do not have to install ODAC in virtual barn?
default user avatar
Man Kit LAU
50:18
Nothing to install in virtual barn. Everything are installed already
default user avatar
Man Kit LAU
50:57
In virtual barn, all you need is to download lab8exercise.zip, unzip it and open vistual studio as what you seen in the demo from Professor

In VS, it simply pass your string of "sql" to oracle database, so the syntax is the same. But you may need to syntax of string concat to construct the string of sql
