Grading Scheme
There are 4 components for the course assessment: 30% final, 30% midterm, 30% assignments and 10% for lecture, tutorial and lab attendance (e.g. to be present majority of time according to zoom log record).

 

Details of attendance scores (10%):

 

Lectures (4%) â€“ if you are recorded majority of time (at least 60 mins for one single device joining the lecture) in the period to lecture slot, you are given 0.2% for each lecture attendance. Simply put, you need to have at least 20 attendances defined by the above in order to get 4%. There is one more condition: you should give me appropriate response (response icon, voice answers, etc) when you are asked to do so. Otherwise, your score for that lecture is not counted even you get the sufficient recorded time.

 

Tutorial (3%) - If you present 80% or more during the tutorial slot, you will get 0.4% for each lab attendance. Simply put, you need to have at least 6 attendance to get 2.4%. For the rest 0.6%, each of you will be asked two questions during the tutorial sessions in this semester, you need to answer them correctly to get the 0.6%.

 

Labs (3%) - if you are recorded majority of time (at least 30 mins for one single device joining the lab) in the period to lab slot, you are given 0.25% for each lab attendance. From Lab 2, you are required to submit your lab code to canvas in .txt format (submission dead line will be set at 11:59pm Hong Kong Time, Sunday of the lab week). You are given 0.25% for each lab code submission. Simply put, you need to have at least 12 (attendance + code submission) defined by the above in order to get 3%.

 

We expect the exams are conducted under zoom monitoring. It is therefore your sole responsibility to prepare a private environment for the exam with reasonable video transmission under zoom platform. The final exam will be cumulative with emphasis on the post-midterm material.

No make-up exam will be given for the midterm. Thus, 30% is deducted if you are not able to be present for the midterm.

For the final exam, make-up exam is arranged for (i) prior approval is granted by the instructor for extremely special circumstances, or (ii) you are in unfavorable medical condition with physician's documentation on the day of the examination.

Being absent at the final examination results in automatic failure of the course according to university regulations, unless prior approval is obtained from the department head.
