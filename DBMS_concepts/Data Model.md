# Data Model

A data model describes how data can be organized
logically as well as any restrictions on the data.

Example:

1. Entity-Relationship (E-R) model
   (Users view data as entities and "explicit" relationships among entities.

2. Relational model
   (Users view data as tables and "implicit" relationships among tables.)
